:description: Use Serving with {product-title} ingress sharding

This page describes how {serverless} Serving can be used with {product-title} ingress sharding.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{serverlessproductname} Serving is a Developer Preview feature only. {serverlessproductname} - Developer Preview releases contain features and functionalities that might not be fully tested. Customers are encouraged to provide feedback on Developer Preview releases. Developer Preview releases are not production-ready, and customers are recommended to avoid using the project for production or business-critical workloads.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to an {product-title} account with cluster administrator access.

* You have an existing {product-title} routing setup that uses ingress shards


.Setting up {product-title} ingress shards

{serverless} can be configured to match specific ingress shards with different domains with a label selector.
The following is an example of how your ingress shard could be configured.
The relevant fields are marked:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
metadata:
  name: ingress-dev  <1>
  namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
spec:
  routeSelector:
    matchLabels:
      router: dev  <2>
  domain: "dev.serverless.cluster.example.com"  <3>
  #... other settings ...
---
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
metadata:
  name: ingress-prod  <1>
  namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
spec:
  routeSelector:
    matchLabels:
      router: prod  <2>
  domain: "prod.serverless.cluster.example.com"  <3>
  #... other settings ...
----
<1> The names of your ingress shard, here as an example `dev` and `prod` for different stages
<2> A label selector to match the ingress shard
<3> A custom domain for the ingress shard

Replace these values with your own configuration.

.Configuring custom domains in the `KnativeServing` CustomResource

To match the ingress shards, you need to configure `KnativeServing` to use the same domains and labels as your ingress shards.
For this you need to create or edit your `KnativeServing` resource and add the `spec.config.domain` field:
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  config:
    domain: <1>
      dev.serverless.cluster.example.com: |
        selector:
          router: dev
      prod.serverless.cluster.example.com: |
        selector:
          router: prod
----
<1> These values have to match to the ones in the ingress shard configuration.

.Targeting a specific ingress shard in the Knative Service

You can now target a specific ingress shard in your Knative `Service` resources using a label:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-dev
  labels:
    router: dev  <1>
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: docker.io/openshift/hello-openshift
---
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-prod
  labels:
    router: prod  <1>
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: docker.io/openshift/hello-openshift
----
<1> This have to match the configuration in `KnativeServing`

.Verification

With this setup, your Knative Services should use the correct route and the selected ingress shard:
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ksvc
NAME         URL                                                             LATESTCREATED      LATESTREADY        READY   REASON
hello-dev    https://hello-dev-default.dev.serverless.cluster.example.com    hello-dev-00001    hello-dev-00001    True
hello-prod   https://hello-prod-default.prod.serverless.cluster.example.com  hello-prod-00001   hello-prod-00001   True
----
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get route -n knative-serving-ingress -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{@.metadata.name}{" "}{@.spec.host}{" "}{@.status.ingress[*].routerName}{"\n"}{end}'
route-19e6628b-77af-4da0-9b4c-1224934b2250-323461616533 hello-prod-default.prod.serverless.cluster.example.com ingress-prod
route-cb5085d9-b7da-4741-9a56-96c88c6adaaa-373065343266 hello-dev-default.dev.serverless.cluster.example.com ingress-dev
----

[NOTE]
====
Please be aware that even with OpenShift ingress sharding in place, the {serverless} traffic is still routed through a single Knative Ingress Gateway and the activator component in the `knative-serving` project.
Please also take a look at xref:./../service-mesh/common-service-mesh-network-isolation.adoc[] for more information about isolating the network traffic.
